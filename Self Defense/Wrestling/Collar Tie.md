Most people don't realize, the purpose of a Collar Tie is the **push** with your wrist on their clavicle/trap region.  Then when he "puts the breaks on", then you pull.
You don't want to just grab a Collar Tie and hold because then his back gets all stiff and it's now impossible to [[Snap Down]].

> [!warning] Breaking the Collar Tie
> Rotate your shoulder into him but maintain your posture. Do NOT pull away (pictured below) because this compromises your stance.

Another way to break the double collar tie is to
1. Switch your stance (note: everyone underhooks with the same side as the lead leg)
2. Push on his lat and pull with your underhook to spin him away (This leaves you with the underhook)
