The ideal underhook position owns all 3 control points: Inside Thigh, Inside Head, Deep Under Hook

The further your head gets away from your underhook, the weaker you get

Cup their shoulder, as deep as you can, keeping their shoulder rolled forward or else they can go for a Mir Lock as seen below

> [!Caution]
> If you have an underhook don't put your arm around their waist without [[Inside Thigh]] Position. All they have to do is step to the inside and throw.  Contradictory Note: The suplex is available here

Spindown from deep underhook

Options from Deep Underhook:
- Spindown
- Body Lock (if you have inside thigh position and they stand up tall)
- [[Throw By]] (if they go to square up)
- Run through
- [[Single Leg]]

If they get [[Inside Thigh]] Position, abandon the under hook immediately and go to [[Single Leg]].
