# Conceptual Overview: Stance
The "same side" arm of the lead leg should always protect the lead leg.
If you reach with the lead arm, it is no longer defending, and your opponent can post on the elbow to gain access to your lead leg

It is essential to maintain a neutral spine and keep your shoulder inline with your knees.  If your shoulders are forward of your knees you can easily be pulled forward.
If your shoulders are behind your knees, you can easily be pushed back.

Neutral spine = strong back and strong stance
Do not round your head or spine

> [!tip: The Goal]
Take your opponent our of their strong stance without compromising your strong stance.
This is achieved by grip fighting as well as manipulating your opponent's distribution of their weight.

Example: Moving their weight to their back leg makes their lead leg light

### Out of Position
"To have your defense incorrectly positioned to be able to defend your opponents attacks "
- Being too postured upright where you don't have your arms and head able to defend
- Taking and underhook without head position
- Giving up inside thigh position

- Not immediately recovering to a proper stance after a failed shot

Perfect example of Out of Position (left) and In Position (right)

> This "push-pull" is the backbone of getting your opponent out of position

# Conceptual Overview: Posts
## Layers of Defense
Layer 1: Feet
Layer 2: Knees

Layer 1: Hands
Layer 2: Elbows

The first is more defense (more options and a better Post) than the second.  If you let someone build up they will have more defense.
> You don't want your opponent's Layers of Defense on the mat or on you.

## Stay off the waist
(with the exception of having Inside Thigh Position)
> You don't want to give up a good Single or Double Leg and go to the waist if the opponent has inside thigh position.  

If you're on the legs, it means their layers of defense are immobilized and off the ground.
>Your priority should be to stay on the legs and finish the takedown.  Letting go of the single for the side body lock, you give your opponent the space to defend.

Fight for Inside Thigh Position to block their throws.
> They need Inside Thigh and Hip position to execute throws

You must always attack the Post to keep your opponent on the mat.

> With Lower Body Takedowns, you attack the Post first and then look to control the torso
> With Upper Body Takedowns, you control the torso first and then look to attack the post

The same is true with passing (clear legs, control torso in either order)

You can attack their Posts to keep them from getting back up.
