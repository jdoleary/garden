Best done when you have a Deep [[Under Hook]] and your opponent goes to square up.
When you execute, grab the inside of their leg so they can't run / move as they could if you go straight for a body lock.

Once you get to the back, it's best to wrap up the legs because if you just wrap his waist he has lots of counterattack options.
