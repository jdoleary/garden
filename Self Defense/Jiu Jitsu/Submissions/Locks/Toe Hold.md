[Nicky Ryan Toe Hold](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxbS2f1nE7MUrIOmYAUcBV9DURycXdpIsK)
	- Go "elbow deep" on the achilles
	- "back heel" (to protect your own feet) and pinch knees together (for control)
	- Retract the shoulder and pull the elbow back.  HOLD the toes, and pull the elbow back.  it's the opposite arm that you would assume that does the work.
