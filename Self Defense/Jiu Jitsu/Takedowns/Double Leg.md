- [No Gi Double Leg Takedown](https://youtu.be/7igJLHdcg1I) by [[Lachlan Giles]]
	- You're momentum should be going UP not down or else you'll get easily sprawled on, this is why it's important to drop your level
	- [practise](https://youtu.be/7igJLHdcg1I?t=75)
	- [Your frontleg has to get to at least the line of their front foot](https://youtu.be/7igJLHdcg1I?t=89)
	- Always step with your frontleg first, it's the quickest
	- [Front knee goes to the mat, get your hips low](https://youtu.be/7igJLHdcg1I?t=120)
	- Shoulder connects before your leg hits the mat
	- Connect hands together or grab the back of the legs just above the knees https://youtu.be/7igJLHdcg1I?t=148
		- if you grab around the waist they can step wide
	- When you land, land outside their legs
	- Early: You want your hands on the inside https://youtu.be/7igJLHdcg1I?t=280 for the tie up
