BMAC: the fundamentals of Jiu Jitsu are balance, weight distribution, leverage, timing, patience, perseverance (and more unnamed)
Fighting electric chair, reap (fighting the sweep) often causes ACL tears

There a two ways that people get injured:
Ignorance to a position of vulnerability 
Or 
Refusal to tap when in a position of vulnerability because their ego cannot acknowledge that they’ve already lost by allowing that position

Try not to squeeze chokes,
If the accuracy is good they will tap after 10-15 seconds

Rob vernaky:
Maximize your posture, structure and base

The 5 main controls points of wrestling: behind head, in armpits, behind knees/ under hips. Don’t let anyone have these


## My current focus
I'm feeling overwhelmed because I"m focusing on too much at once.  I should set a single intention before class and then review after class how it went and what I learned.
My biggest weakness right now is side-control escapes.
- From a neutral position
  - Attempt sweep to gain dominant
- From a disadvantaged position
  - Escape, restore neutrality
  - Suprise attack
- From an advantaged position
  - Maintain, don't get swept
  - Effortless submission

 Study your weak points, you should have a balanced familiarity with 
## Class notes
- "Frames beat inside position, but angles beat frames" https://youtu.be/E4j8_IFR8FE?t=645
- "The tighter the grip on the head, the harder it will be to escape" https://youtu.be/E4j8_IFR8FE?t=450
- "Any time your hips point away from your opponent, you're screwed" https://youtu.be/gHt-tXYLBc8?t=260
- It's easier to put in your top hook than your bottom hook https://youtu.be/qpK368JQXSc?t=215
- 2022-08-08
  - Observations from Jordan Teaches Jiu Jitsu https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELju8-vnXHw
    - keep your shoulder glued to you neck when you sense guillotine
    - If someone flexibly tries to lift their hips to escape north south, you can keep their hips down by pushing into their belly with your head and lifting their shoulders.
    - Don't let your head go in front of your knees when standing https://youtu.be/iwyBXiR9iEI?t=329
    - controlling the far arm from half guard prevents their offense https://youtu.be/iwyBXiR9iEI?t=377 
    - kneeslide
      -  keep hips glued to the body the whole time
      - When passing with knee slide, put your inside knee on their outside leg to prevent the knee shield https://youtu.be/UAIoIpefvxw?t=164
      - Also, Keep your elbow on the inside of their outside leg to prevent their getting inside position https://youtu.be/UAIoIpefvxw?t=300
      - arm on sliding side should grab head, tricep, or elbow to keep them on their back
      - other arm must get an underhook to prevent the back-take defense

- 2022-08-01
  - Against bigger opponents
    - underhook the leg in side control to keep them from bench pressing you off https://youtu.be/dBBocnnCDw4?t=60
    - Don't put your knees down, stay on your toes
    - Never let them control your ankles or wrist (hide them)
    - Try the inverted guard - use your speed of transition as an advantage (change back and forth quickly)
    - Go for leg locks (most powerful) or take the back (most secure) to submit them
- 2022-07-27
  - Importance of grip fighting
  - Importance of not getting your head grabbed (number 1 priority)
    - Offbalance them to make them let go
  - Back takes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5Vc9nTX3VI
    - the only thing stopping someone from taking your back is their arm, use underhooks to get around
    - When attempting this, control the far arm to prevent the darce https://youtu.be/I5Vc9nTX3VI?t=336 
  - Keeping your legs pointing in the same direction for triangle setup
  - Kimura Trap escapes / counters
    - [armbar](https://youtu.be/xyCakxmx-2E?t=218)
    - Slip the elbow through
    - [turn their kimura into YOUR kimura](https://youtu.be/xyCakxmx-2E?t=350)

  - Lately I've been thinking about my weak points.  At first it was side control. I really never succeeded at escapes until I did solo training with Chris.  Then I noticed it was defending guard (not getting pulled down). And now Kesa Gatame.
  - However, I have been escaping some pretty deep positions lately, so pieces are coming together and it's working.
  - I notice that I'm laking knowledge.  I'm relying too much on wanting to move by principles so much that I haven't bothered to learn the letters of the language first.  I want to know what other people have figured out first before I try to figure out my own stuff.  I should focus on memorizing my options.
- 2022-06-18
  - Colin keeps getting me with guillotines.  I asked Coach Tracy and he said defend with "2 on 1".  The pulling arm is hardly useful (think end of range pullup), whereas the pushing arm is much more useful.
- 2022-06-06
  - If I want to be very good at JiuJitsu I have to learn efficiently, because I don't have lots of time.
    - To learn efficiently, I must:
      1. Remember what I learn - convert short term into long term - so I don't have to revisit too much
      2. Understand the principles.  What about this concept is shared with others?  What body mechanics is it taking advantage of?
- 2022-06-05 Open Mat
  - Learned about protecting neck from head spike from Chris.  Flex traps like a body builder and point head up
  - Had a lot of success with Danaher triangle technique
  - Used Paulson toe control rather than ankle control when passing guard to good success
  - Learned about head crank in umaplata position from Chris
  - Failed to do sidecontrol escapes
- 2022-05-26
  - 4/11 from butterfly with lift and spin, oldschool butterfly to 4/11
  - Coach tracy got me with a wrist lock when I had back position and he trapped by left arm against the ground and then one arm wrist locked
  - He also got me with an ankle lock when he pinned my leg with his leg and just pulled up on my toes.
- 2022-05-08
  - Lately I'm thinking on how much breaking the opponent's "stack" or "base" matters.  I've had a couple triangle where I have it locked in, but their base is so good that I'm suffering or they can knee on my head.  I must break down their base
- Momentum is necessary (think kazushi) to sweep an opponent, don't just try to execute itt when you want.  Wait for the right moment.
- 2022-04-16
  - Rener triangle defense is all about blocking the hip, if they can't get the hip under you they can't finish the triangle.  Block the hip using your "in" arm:
    - block, walk, underhook and feed; and you've killed the triangle
    - https://youtu.be/sR2rS2dwpNY?t=25
- 2022-04-13
  - triangle from the back
    - The key I was missing is to have the foreleg across their neck, not the thigh
    - No, Tracy clarified, it's the same ratchet as the regular triangle, grab the shin and rotate to ratchet
  - I had Tre's back and he lunched in the air and I hit my head on the mat.  Must protect my head at all times.  On cement that'd be a fight ender
    - The deeper lesson here is don't attach your body to theirs in an upright position, even if they are in turtle or squatting.  They have the ability to launch back or to either side
- 2022-04-07
  - Leg locks
    - Ashi Garami
      - bottom side
      - topside
    - 4/11
      - Cloverleaf
    - Reaper
  - If they jump over the bottom leg,
    - Dig it out with outside ashi and cover the top foot with the bottom
    - Go to knees for harry potter knee bar
    - Keep spinning to fall into 4/11
- 2022-04-05
  - Takedowns
    - Pummel for double underhooks
    - Tip them to one side to make them compensate, then slip around behind them an sit to your butt while blocking their far leg with your foot (on the ground)
  - Counters:
    - Twister: get their elbow and shoulder (from around the back of their head) and spin away from them and take your back foot to a knee, driving their head to the ground
    - Judo throw
- 2022-04-04
 - Attacks from guard
  - Armbar
  - Kimura
  - Triangle
  - Pyramid
    - Overhook and head control
    - "Legless" hip out
    - leg over the head & in front of the shoulder
    - C-cup elbow and get your knee through
      - Touch your knee and heel
    - Pinch
    - Slide their arm up your knee for kimura
- 2022-04-01
  - Butterfly with Sensei Tracy
    - Keep the sweep leg attached
    - Don't pull them back on top of you, they may just push your legs down and go to mount
    - Instead, just drive your head to the mat on the overhook side
- 2022-03-06
  - Improving lockdown.  Think about their hip position relative to mine.  Curling my head under their body does NOT give me an advantage in terms of weight distrobution.  Instead, during whip up you must move their whole body up and over so your hips are besides their leg, not in front.
- 2022-03-03
  - Straight arm lock. Use elbow pointed away as a lever to increase the angle of their arm from the floor so you have more room to push down.  Focus on the battle for the elbow before you even worry about your other arm.
  - TODO: Research ghost escape and other bottom side control escapes
- 2022-03-01
  - Jedi position.  When in their guard, if you round you back like a "C" (lower back out), it is harder for them to pull you back in with their legs.  When they break their guard, get both your arms under their legs and go "neck to balls".  Then hike them up so all the pressure is on their neck - plank and pressure forward (don't twist your upper body).  Put one fist next to their neck, on the side you plan to make their legs fall. then just twist your pelvis slightly and their legs will fall.

Assuming you are on the top or dominant side, the hierarchy is traditionally as follows:

Rear mount
Mount
Knee-on-belly
Side control
Turtle
Half guard
Open Guard
Closed guard

A dominant position is one that:

Is easier to maintain than it is to escape
Grants you mechanical advantages and leverage against your opponent
You are relatively safe from strikes and submissions
You are better able to end the fight with strikes or submissions

Principles:
- Connection
- Detachment
- Distance
- Pyramid
- Creation
- Acceptance
  - "The earlier you can identify inevitability, the more energy and time is available to you to do as you wish"
  - Ex: to accept twisting arm control is to roll with it all the way around and then hip out to ashi
  - Question 1: "What would Acceptance yield in this technique?  What opportunities would going with it create?"
  - Question 2: "What is the point of no return?"
- Velocity
- Clock
- River
- Frame
- Kuzushi
- Reconnaissance
- Prevention
- Tension
- Fork
- Posture
- False Surrender
- Depletion
- Isolation
- Sacrifice
- Momentum
- Pivot
- Tagalong
- Overload
- Anchor
- Ratchet
- Buoyancy
- Head Control

## BJJ Fundamentals https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDnr6NYImck

Most important move is the elbow escape
Curiosity of problem solving (instead of attempting to win practice) yields much higher rewards over time

Closed guard moves: - Triangle - Arm Bar - Sweep - Arm over the back

    Choke with legs, hips, and movement (don't squeeze with arms)
    "Hip oriented grappler"

"Anything that smacks of competition destroys knowledge." -NNT

The jist is: you have many options, don't ever greedily commit to one option - feel your opponent out and take whichever option they give you.

## Chris Haueter

Act like it's a real fight / don't get complacent:
Hands, Head, Hips
Choke with your hips, not with your grips
The Hips are what move the body
Watchout for headbut uppercut https://youtu.be/vpCt9JAAx18?t=1100
Your eyes lie to you, you can trick grapplers by drawing their eyes, go by FEEL instead.
Everyone is dangerous

1. be the guy on top
2. when on top stay on top
3. when on bottom have a guard 'you shall not pass'
4. never forget rule #1, easily forgotten due to the seductive and rewarding nature of guard
5. Learn these rules so you can break them

- To get someone to do something, do the opposite. If you want them to lift their head, push it down. Vice versa.
  If you want them to go towards you, push them away. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCbCLgF7X9k

## Rener and Ryron

Prinicple Based Learning
Allows you to stay relaxed and conserve engery
- When you're sparring, how many moments can you notice when you can pivot or when your opponent is pivoting around you.
## Own notes
Since the best "escape" is a preventative escape.  Like Chris (purple belt from 10th planet) said, do NOT act unless you have a reason.
