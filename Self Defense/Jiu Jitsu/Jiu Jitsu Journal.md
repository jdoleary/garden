	- I've been working on [[Balance, Posture and Alignment]] and I recorded tape of myself rolling and couldn't help but notice every time I fell to my hip it was because I lacked proper alignment.  My back leg was perpendicular to my opponent (not pointing at him) and so he was able to drive me over that edge.
	- When I was a white belt, I didn't "get" hand-fighting.  I kind of just thought it was something I needed to get out of the way so I could get to the "actually important stuff", but now I understand that hand-fighting is **how** combatants establish dominant position and all else flows from there.

	- Big realization today: I was watching another [[Henry Akins]] video about escaping side control by being on your side and keeping your arm down and I realized I missed a huge detail.  You need to be turned towards them! Not away.  This brings me back to the concept that [reality has a suprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail).  If I show you a triangle inside a square and ask you to describe it to a friend who hasn't seen it so they may draw it, there is a good chance that the instructions you'll give them will allow them to draw thousands of square circle combinations that meet your instructions but do not match the original picture.  This is because when you see the image you remember "triangle inside square", but you may miss important details that distinguish it from other possible combinations of that description.  "What direction is the triangle facing?", "What angle?", "Does the triangle intersect the sides of the square on each point", etc, etc, etc.  This same effect is at play when learning Jiu Jitsu.  It takes a long time to capture all the relevant details, many which are unspoken because there are so many details it is difficult to call them all out.

	- At the seminar today, learned from Levi that the **direction** of the choke matters.  For example, to find the direction of the choke in an arm triangle, first practice choking with one arm from side control.  Bring your middle finger into the armpit from under their head and test different angles until you find the right angle.  This is the same angle used in the arm triangle.  The direction or angle of the choking limb also applies in RNC, leg triangle, etc.
	- Adlai: Standing game
		- Arm drag if not connected
		- If connected and they have a wrestler's posture, use a snapdown
		- If connected and they are upright, foot sweeep

	- Studied single legs with Jack.  You want their leg between your knees or on the opposite side, they have way more options on the same side.  If you are on the same side there's a trip (see the beginning of this video: https://youtu.be/BEQ3MQFe2tQ).  But cross-side or between legs is idea
	- Worked with Coach on Mount escapes and side control escapes.
		- Mount 
			- He mentioned to pay attention to the situation and apply the right escape for each situation
			- If they have an underhook, just fake a bump and roll to that side and they'll have to post and you can get your underhook back.
		- Side control
			- if they pressure in too much you can go octopus guard and roll them
			- If they have you in their lap, gable grip your hands, crunch, and drive your elbows down to get both frames. Crunch the shoulder, Then walk your legs away to make space, extending through your frames and now you can go for the single leg.

	- Need to work on guillotine form.  I'm catching it but not finishing.  I think maybe my arm is too deep.
	- Need to keep practicing Sissor sweep
	- Refine cross sides defense.  I think my top arm is keeping me from turning on my side
	- When strangling, thing of cooking them, like a chicken.  It's not to reach a certain point of pressure but to have pressure and hold it long enough.  I've been squeezing hard for a few seconds and then releasing when they don't tap.

	- Thinking about Henry Akins advice for not pushing to prevent side control because it gives them leverage to drive your shoulder to the mat and flatten you out.
	- Thinking of The J curve and how it prevents losing your posture in guard
	- Thinking of BMacs advice for keeping your sternum glued to their spine and ear to ear for back control
	- Thinking about how the first half of setting up Judo moves is Kazushi.  If I practice unbalancing the rest of the move is right there.

	- Realizing some of my specific weakpoints:
		- What attacks I see as available are very very limited.  I often go for back takes, triangles, straight ankle locks, wrist locks and not much else.  I rarely try for arm bars, kimuras, guillotines
		- I don't fully commit to sweeps.  Step 1, block the post. Step2, apply the tipping force.  If you're going to go for it, go for it with commitment.
		- I don't chain things together.  If I fail a hip bump sweep, the kimura is right there.
	- Started reading "Kodukan Judo"
		- "The basis of kuzushi is pushing and pulling, which are done with the whole body"
		- "Mastery of tai-sabaki (body mechanics - foot movement) is the key to executing effective throwing techniques"
		- In tsugi-ashi (movement when close to an opponent, one foot always leads and the other follows)
		- "before making an attack, one should note his opponent's weight, build, strong points, temperament and so on"
		- The fundamental principle of judo: "whatever the objective, it is best attained by the maximum-efficient use of mind and body for that purpose"
	- Think on the wrist curl (grabbing with your whole wrist curled, not just your hand) wether its to apply a kimura or defending spiderweb

	- Learned today that to defend a straight ankle lock you don't clear the knee line.  The knee line doesn't really matter for SAL.  You put the boot on, clear their top leg (in ashi), and stand up.  Pushing through is the only way, you can't pull out

	- Proper turtle as a backup after they sprawl on your or after you get your guard passed
	- You have to rotate as you do it, not just go to your side in order to change the angle
	- Use the shoulders to protect against seatbelt
	- Resist neck-tie with turtle neck (shrugging your shoulders)
	- [Wrist fighting to prevent seatbealt](https://youtu.be/taIB7Axc5bs?t=551) magnets, they never touch
	- [He rolls Jordan over when he goes for the seatbelt by trapping his arm and rolling into it](https://youtu.be/taIB7Axc5bs?t=622)
		- He moves right from the tight elbow to wrist control when Jordan reaches in
	Also saw an instagram video of Yani Silverio from @trapplegate10p in competition.  The incredible thing about that video was how calm and non jumpy he was.  He just moved forward slowly and decisively while his opponent was bouncing all over the place.  He didn't use any extra energy, and when he saw the opportunity, he took it.

	-  Reading Saulo Ribeiro's Jiu Jitsu University and studying Survival.
		- Went over back, mount, side, sitting mount, turtle, kesa gatame.  It appears the strategy for them all is the same: keep your elbows closed, hand fight and block their ability to control your head, put them at bad angles to attack, keep them off balance.
	- Also watched Jordan Teaches Jiu Jitsu tips video and I'm thinking about the tips:
		- Never let them grab your head (how that corresponds to Saulo's side control defense)
		- keep your toes on the mat in side control offense

	-  Studying Ghost and Phantom escapes from Side Control.  It seems the common main points are:
		- Trap the arm that would allow the opponent to recapture control (prevents north south)
		- Escape out the hip side

	-  Studied Darce and guillotine today.  I feel like any of these that I get a sub with is due to a crank rather than a choke so I need to focus on the choke details.  [[Guillotine#^083aea]]
	- Garry Tonon emphasizes the crushing force of bringing their chin into their chest, arms up, crush down.  This is the "sissor" motion that creates the crush to allow it to be a strangle.
	- The Ruotolo brothers [[Darce#^0d58b1]] show how to create the sissor motion in the darce.  He creates the triangle shape with his arms and then demonstrates how pointing the elbow creates the structure and pulling the other arm back closes the "paper cutter".  This makes me think of my thought work with the triangle from back where I figured out if you move your hips in the right direction, you get the paper cutter force closing on the neck.  In any triangle (litterally the shape of the legs or arms, not a specific jiu jitsu move), there are two fixed edges and one moving edge.  Understand the moving edge
