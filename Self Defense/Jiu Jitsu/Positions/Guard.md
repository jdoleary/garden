Posture

## In Guard
- The attacker (guard haver) attempts to break the posture.  The posture is mostly controlled via the hip therefore the defender can keep their posture by making the "S" curve of their back into a  "J"  curve because that is where the battle is: the lowerback / hips.  The attacker must create a concave lowerback in the defender in order to break their posture.  Don't rely on your hands.  Outstretched arms are a liability.
- [[Henry Akins]] Guard Break
	- "J" curve in the back (tuck your hips)
	- Sit on your ankles, do not have "active toes"
	- pinch your knees together on their hips
		-  knees too far apart limits your hip mobility
	- Open the legs with your elbow and a supinated grip https://youtu.be/730WVb-ffgY?t=824
		- Push the knee to the outside, not forward
	- The moment of steeping back is an opportunity for them to break your posture
		- https://youtu.be/730WVb-ffgY?t=900
		- so be careful not to lean forward
		- the key is "timing" the knee switch and trying not to lean forward https://youtu.be/730WVb-ffgY?t=1027

	- What to avoid:
		- Don't lean forward
		- Don't spread your knees wide

	- Don't rely on your hands / arms for posture because it makes you vulnerable
	- Feet flat, no active toes
	- Knees pinching slightly, not too open.  This allows you to "hip in" / pelvic tilt

	- Keep your shoulders behind their belt
	- look forward, not at them (3:50)
	- JiuJitsu is all about blocking.  The opponent is a wall, instead of pushing on the wall to move the wall, you block the wall and move yourself away.
	- 4:50 must wait for his shoulders to be off the floor to break.  If his shoulders are down, his hip is working
- Recover posture

- Hip relationship to defense
	- It's very important as a defender in someones guard to have your hips squared up with theirs.  In order to attack, they need to disconnect their hips and get some kind of angle or distance

## Funnel of Control
- Most defensive control (in their guard) to Most offensive control (has them in guard) from defender's perspective
	- High in the funnel
		- Good posture (state of not being broken down which is required to move to submission)
		- Hip Connection (state of keeping a good angle in relation to their posture)
		- Good balance (prevents sweeps)
	- Lower in the funnel (wip)
# Passing
- Double unders.
	- Do not reach down with fingers, you'll get triangled, instead break the guard with your elbows and flare them out, then rotate your arms
- 2 on 1 pass
- Pressure pass to combat base
