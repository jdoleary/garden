- Don't tap strangers.  This is my own rule of thumb.  If someone is stronger and/or bigger than you and you tap them, it may wound their ego and they may turn up the intensity and end up injuring you.  Instead, just work for positional control.  Getting and keeping the control is 90% of the battle anyway (funnel of control).  Only tap people who you trust or who don't seem potentially dangerous to you.
