## Alignment
You can break someone's alignment by manipulating their spine.  This can be done via the head, shoulders, or hips.
### Control the spine with the Head
Control the head with a crossface or chin strap.  If you ever get to head and arm control from on top (e.g. after a [[Snap Down]]), get a [chin strap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR28BqtFNrg).  The chin strap allows for exceptional spinal control and allows you to easily break your opponent's alignment

### Limbs facing your opponent
Another key part of alignment is pointing your limbs at your opponent.  A frame is much more powerful if your limb is pointing at your opponent (in alignment).  It is much harder to push someone over if their legs are pointing at you.
