# Submit

Submit is the stage in the [[Funnel of Control]] where you have established dominant position via the [[Control]] stage and are ready to give up a small amount of control in order to pursue a submission.

Exceptions:
- Sometimes submission does not necessitate giving up control, but often it does because you must reassign one or more limbs from the task of controlling the opponent to the task of submitting.
- Sometimes submission can be accomplished without first going through the control stage (for example: Catch Wrestling)
