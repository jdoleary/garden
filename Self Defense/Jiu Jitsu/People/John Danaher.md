- Rear Naked Choke details https://youtube.com/shorts/oYDe-hrazL8?feature=share
- If you're trying to control an opponent's limb, keep it attached to your chest [example bmac](https://youtu.be/VFWb7SWF_PE?t=100) rather than letting your body go in the direction you want it to and pulling with your arms.  Applies to kimura, armbar, ![[Armbar#^652cd3]], etc ^connection
- "The whole theory of pin escapes comes down to getting inside your opponents wedges"
- "The entire bottom game of jiu jitsu is centered around the mover knowing his shrimping"
	- There are many forms of shrimping and they must be taken  seriously (not a warmup)
	- Type 1: Sliding shrimp
		- Move foot outside of hip line
		- [Everything comes off the map except hip and shoulder and then whole hips come up to shoulder line](https://youtu.be/EMEueexp9zU?t=381)
	- [Type 2: Power shrimp](https://youtu.be/EMEueexp9zU?t=435)
		- Start with a bridging action (single shoulder bridge)
			- There's the theme of diagonal lines again
			- You know you're doing a Single Shoulder Bridge correctly when your bridge-side knee touches the floor and your elbow is in close to your side and your head is up
		- Critical: "The first movement of a good elbow escape is a power shrimp and then it is followed by 2 sliding shrimps"
			- Off balances them first, then their leg is light
		- Detail: The fingers of the hand that pushes the knee: [the fingers point downwards](https://youtu.be/EMEueexp9zU?t=772) to prevent them from getting your underhook.

When someone locks eyes with you that means they're getting ready to fight.

Think in terms of inside position JD
Wedging is the means of pinning, body weight just reinforces wedges JD
**Adaptive Intelligent Persistance** is how you improve
[Triangle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDE0fkzZT6I)
- Remove the shoulder from the loop
- Bring the shoulder side leg to the choking leg, not the other way around
- If your heads are lined up (bodies angled the same), they can break the triangle by posturing up and or forward
