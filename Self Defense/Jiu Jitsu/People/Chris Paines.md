Guards is a parasite because it makes you comfortable on your back
If the passer doesn’t control your bottom leg, you can just get up
[https://open.spotify.com/episode/417SaQes53sTusIxCa3F6p?si=MERpkB0GTCiozZEUz4Nb7Q&context=spotify%3Ashow%3A37nBZFYDj876z7czvZI9m2](https://open.spotify.com/episode/417SaQes53sTusIxCa3F6p?si=MERpkB0GTCiozZEUz4Nb7Q&context=spotify%3Ashow%3A37nBZFYDj876z7czvZI9m2)
If you’re the guy on top, you remove most of their submission options. 
You are on top of your hips are higher than theirs. 
“Forcing their hand into their pocket”: means “grab their wrist and elbow and force their wrist into their right pocket and glue it to their hip”
The person on the outside can do upper body attacks. The person with inside position can do lower body attacks
There’s no double leg unless they get past your hands and elbows. If you have to sprawl you’ve already made a mistake
Sometimes “just standing up” will induce your opponent to kazushi themselves or give you good grips accidentally in a wild attempt to maintain control

## Subconscious Priorities
https://youtu.be/qX30Wx5glJg?t=900 
Breathing and Balance are subconscious priorities below the primary priority of fighting.  If you interrupt either, they have to address it primarily for a moment.  Cause a reaction in those and then hunt the gap from the reaction immediately.

----
Superior Side __Control__
https://youtu.be/qX30Wx5glJg?t=1392
The conventional head & arm control always leaves space for them to frame on your hip, instead put both arms on one side of their head and keep their near arm in the pocket of your hip

----
The only side control escape you need to know is to get your hands to your groin
https://youtu.be/qX30Wx5glJg?t=1475
----
The rule for joint locks:
https://youtu.be/qX30Wx5glJg?t=2096
You control above and below the one you want.
There's a positional joint and a submission joint.
Armbar example: https://youtu.be/qX30Wx5glJg?t=2200
Crushing, intense control over the __positional__ joint makes the submission __way__ more dangerous / powerful.  Think of how Gordon tapped cyborg before even applying the submission, just with the control on his leg

----
Right-handedness matters, especially in positions like half-guard
https://youtu.be/qX30Wx5glJg?t=2715

Attributes: Athlete, Fighter, Martial Artist.  All exist in world champions

From a podcast: also try to avoid using strength in competition.  It's not just for training.  Being smooth and not using strength until the right moment keeps you relaxed and effective

1. "As long as I keep my hips facing the floor - my groin facing the ground - I am very difficult to sweep"

2. Whoever's hips are highest is on top. (This is useful both when sweeping and when being swept)

## 2023-09-21 Notes - 2nd Session with Chris
Good skiiers are not always balanced, they're always unbalanced and making micro adjustments to remain balanced.

Balance is an athletic skill, not a technical skill.  It's conditioned and you can lose it.

The idea of a pyramid base with 2 feet instead of 3 roots, the concept of edges and corners still applies.  You can't push someone over a corner, only an edge.

---
Attackers delete space, defenders make space
For training with bigger guys. Mess with their balance, mess with their posture.
Don't let them past your knees, don't let them control their hips.
Mess with their spine.

In wrestling you can't just grab someone by the head, you havve to go head and arm. -someone else (due to the ruleset) - Sven
The only thing you should ever be looking for is getting behind somone's shoulder - Sven
Get his shoulder behind your shoulder
**arm drag, russion tie.  Assume they're stronger, so don't move them, move yourself**
If someone's front arm opens that's the shoulder you get behind.  Just push the arm out of the way.
As soon as its open, its weak.
Every bit of hand fighting is a timing thing.
Keep your front arm down, short hand fight, don't drop your head or it'll get stnapped down.  Keep your discipline, keep your posture.  Slide step instead of walking and crossing over your feet.
Keep hunting for the back of their elbow.  Get your belly button on them (so you're not leaning forward and have connection rather than eyes up. This keeps your posture good.)

As soon as i  get past their shoulder i get my belly button on them and just drive them down.

For standing, don't bend over, keep your back up and your front arm down (close the front door)

Don't open your front arm until it has to be fired for an attack


**After I get behind their shoulder and connect, my ability to get up and behind them is based on my bottom leg being free!**

You can weave your bottom leg through your top leg so that you can get your hips facing the ground, this makes it easier to get your bottom leg free so you can get up and get behind them.

Focus on rotating your hips as fast as possible
If they start pullling their arm out and rotating back into you, you need to get your rotation in and fast

---
When defending, as soon as you feel the opportunity to create space (moving yoru hips and shoulders), do it.  (Violently start moving them).  If they can't stop your movement your out, if they're trying to stop it, they can't submit them.

3 planes of motion: Rotate on the axis, extend and contract, laterally move shoulders and hips
Perfect back control has to address all of these.

Nexst time someone is on my back, go left or right, move your shoulders or move your hips laterally, and contract or extend.  If you start moving yhour shoulders they'll hold your shoulders tighter and loosen on your hips and vice versa.  Just get you back off their chest.

Create space all of the time and they will have a much harder time submitting you.

## Key points
- [[Balance]] is the trunk of the "Tree of Jiu Jitsu", therefore
	- If you maintain balance, you vastly limit your opponent's options
	- If you compromise the opponent's balance, you give yourself options
	- You could focus on nothing else but balance and be great at Jiu Jitsu
	- "As long as I keep my hips facing the floor - my groin facing the ground - I am very difficult to sweep"
- Whoever's hips are highest is **on top** or will inevitably become the one of top.
- In order to **get up** you must have a free bottom leg
	- This applies to taking the back / getting behind your opponent and getting up when playing guard
- Alignment is the brother of balance, is it what allows you to maintain balance ^3226a9
	- Imagine triangle on the ground made by lines connecting the points of your body in contact with the ground.  This is your [[base]].
	- Your base can only be compromised by pushing you over an edge, not a corner, of that shape.
	- Your base can only be compromised by pushing you over an edge, not a corner, of that shape.
	- This principle applies even when you're standing.  The shape is just a line between your feed, but if you fall, it will be because you were pushed or pulled over the edge, the line between your feet, and not over a corner (the feet themselves)
	- Therefore, when standing, remain with the line facing your opponent, or else you are weak and can be easily toppled.
	- This is why we shift, instead of step, when moving in a combat stance.  We do not let our feet cross each other.
- When both combatants are standing, to take them down your only objective is to get behind their shoulder and connect.
	- Think of keeping your belly button connected to them (this ensures good posture)

## 10-28-2023 - notes meeting with Chris

Arm drag: lock the arm in place and walk around it
## Flanking
Takedowns: The only thing I'm looking for is to get around the back of your shoulder.
In Referee position, if they're on the side of you and you can move your leg behind theirs then you're behind their shoulder and you're winning.
It's like what makes one position in Dog Fight superior.
Arm drags work from Referee too.

Can I keep the door closed and get behind you.
If both players are down on the mat, whoever is "winning" is whoever is behind the hips of the other person.  Same principle of getting behind the shoulder.

Practice this on less skilled opponents so you can work it.
"It's not a reflection on me if a lower belt beats me"
It's an important thing to humble yourself or else you deny yourself training in the areas in which you are weak.

This is how keenan learns, try new things against worse people.

On "Just getting up" from darces and arm triangles (darce turn in, arm triangle ball up and turn away and invert)
Turtle to tripod
side bottom - get under them, stand
If someone is going for a darce by pulling my arm I can just get up
You can hold me down while pulling me up.
Arm bars and darces, you need them on the floor
See latest youtube video and instagram
If they try to pull you up, just get up and they'll have to switch to keep you down
Arm Triangle: if they're on the side:
	Hold the back of your knee with the back of your wrist to prevent your shoulder 
	Then turn away
	Because I'm on my side digging my toes into the floor they can't pull me down again
	Roll away and pull my bottom leg underneath me. I'm not sweeping them, I'm moving myself. The roll away almost looks like a gramby, you're curling up and inverting
Mounted Arm Triangle: Go the other way, bridge over shoulder, get your arm to the ground and go baby bridge
> [!note]
> The direction in which you can stand up is also dictated by which arm is free because you need to post on the ground
> In a darce it's the bottom arm so you must turn into them to stand
> In an arm triangle it's the far arm so you must turn away to stand

North south Kimura
![[Pasted image 20231028114552.png|360]]
This pops them off your elbow, then go underneath and get elbow down.
This is just pushing their forearm off
![[Pasted image 20231028114640.png|360]]
Northsouth Kimura survival, just keep shrimping in circles because then they don't have your body.

Escaping the "Control Joint" is always better than escaping the "Submission Joint"
Which affects the "Breakable Joint"

It's hard to move up from the core, it's easy to move away form the core when trying to control
Heel Hook to Toe hold
Kimura to Wrist lock
if you lose the control joint

Inside heel hook, knee bar and outside heel hook all require that I control your hip.
eliete level leg lockers have a crushing grip on your hip
The control joint is the most important to control.  The control joint dictates if you'll be successful

Free the hip vs control the hip IS the leglock shootout
If I ask you to break a stick you have to control both sides of it.

---
## 12/28/2023 Notes Meeting with Chris
Combat base is the same as the standing down block when kneeling.  It does the same thing and protects the same spots.

Standing passing is the same as guard passing.  In guard passing you can go through, over, under or around the knees.  In standing you can go through, over, under or around the hands and elbows.

When standing, if you're going to attach to someone, attach with your belly button or else you're breaking your own posture to take them down.

"The best way of learning takedowns is doing mat returns from non-standing" -Pritt or Danaher or someone

3 phases of takedowns:
1. Good posture
2. Hand fight to get to the core
3. execute the takedown
Practicing mat returns alone allows you to train #3 and refine the end stage where you're already attached to them.

Whoever is sitting behind the other's hip will get the takedown.

Samurai position instead of referee when getting up from running man because it protects your inside position and keeps your head far from their access so you can't get choked.
When you're getting up and they're behind you, if you're holding on to one of their hands, then there's a hole for you to get out (remember 3d control)

Referee is only good if they're in front of you, use samurai if they're behind you and half of each if they're on the side.

**important**
These are the layers of defense:
1. Good Posture
2. Close the door (e.g. protect your inside position)
3. Hold the hand that would go through the door ("kill them on the lawn")
	Don't even let them through the door.

Offense goes in the opposite of these steps.
This applies to standing and ground.

osoto gari gets you past the elbow on the inside.

There has to be a posture break before you can do a successful attack.
	Must keep posture and alignment, keep a straight back. Anytime someone gets you they broke your posture first
Just before I got stuck in anything, my neck rounds.
Try it offensively and defensively.  Keep mine, break theirs.  With a broken posture they find it very hard to attack and feel very vulnerable at the same time.
**If someone is above your kneecap they can twist your knee.**
In terms of getting pushed over, there has to be a line between your feet pointing at them, not that the legs themselves have to point, but the line between them.
Posture and alignment are the same thing...
It's just a game of power.  Alignment is required to generate power.  Power is posture + strength + connection to the floor (direction of generating power)

RNC starting with arm bent is like cutting paper with scissors without opening them.  If you start arm triangle with a bent arm it's like trying to snip paper with closed scissor.  The point is: establish good connection with the most potential leverage first.

If you tie someone's shoulder to their ears you can take mount as slow as you want - Gordon Ryan

Darce: If you elbow them in the armpit you can kimura them and turn out.
If you can make your shoulders and posture wide enough they shouldn't be able to connect their arms.

### TODO
Spend an entire round where I'm just focusing on keeping my posture like I have a book balancing on my head.  Aware that my spine has to be aligned.  Keep my shoulders back and down like I'm rowing. If my head gets pulled down, elevate my hips but don't allow my spine to bend.  Do one round liek this where I don't care if I win or lose, just focus on the posture.  Pretend it's your first day, you don't know any techniques you're only focusing on posture that way your mind isn't split.
The reason I'm not being disciplined with posture is that I'm thinking about too much.

Everything I do, don't think about the tecniques in general, think about how I should break their posture.  Attack their posture relentlessly.
What do you do as the person on top... Posture break - relentlessly.

It's only through lack of discipline that you lose your posture.  It's always the most disciplined people that will succeed.  Don't get emotional and desparate and sacrifice discipline.

TODO: watch the videos back and message when the posture goes wrong.


In terms of escaping referee.  Think of control as 3D and 2D.  if they wrap all the way around you they have 3d control, if they are only on either side of you they have 2D control and there's a direction you can escape.  In Ashi garami, if the knee isn't pinching to the foot there's a "hole" you can escape out of.  Same goes for when they don't have 3D control, just move in the direction that their not preventing you from moving.

- Combat base is essentially the same as standing down block
- Standing passing is the same as guard passing: through, over, under, around
- If you're going to attach to someone, attach with your belly button or else you're breaking your own posture to take them down
- The best way of learning takedowns is doing mat returns
- Three phases of takedown:
	- Good posture
	- hand fight to get to the core
	- execute the takedown
- To learn takedowns do it from the ground.  Just #3, mat return relentlessly
- Whoever is sitting behind the other's hip gets the takedown.
- If you're holding onto their wrist, then they don't have 3D control and there's a way for you to get out
- You can hold onto someone's hand so they can't hold onto you

## Protecting Inside Position
- Phase 0: Maintain Posture
- Phase 1: Close the door (inside position: arm pits to hips, neck to shoulder)
- Phase 2: Hold the hand that would go in the door ("Kill them on the lawn")

## 2024-01-28

Handfighting:
Their 3d control only works if they beat you on the handfight.
Under, over, around, and through (for elbows and knees).
Postmortem the handfights with someone 
- Martial Arts and Philosophy book
	- State of no mind
		- you can postmortem but not narrate in the moment if you are of no mind
		- when postmorteming you're explaining the ideas to yourself
		- stop them and go "What happened there?"
		- Chris: "You're only capable of doing the no mind things because you fully understand"
Standing hand fighting is like open guard, same objectives.  Feet fighting, hand fighting.
What is success in a hand fight?
	 Getting past the hands and elbows to get access to the spine?
	 How? Under, over, around and through.

If you can't get underneath someone's elbows, don't double leg.
Get a takedown associated with each (U, O, A, T).

Chris's whole gym has great wrestling but does no explicit takedown training.  Because they handfight and get to the spine and spend time there.

Work on handfighting consciously and read what they are doing and what options they are giving me.

Training with people who are less skilled gives you great opportunity to learn because they give you one problem to solve at a time, whereas peers or better opponents will shut you down before you can learn.  Train what you don't know with those who are less good so you can experiment and progress.

The "blue belt curse" is what you have to break to get to purple belt.  Don't be afraid of loss to lower belts, you have to experiment to improve.  Be willing to experiment and lose to white belts.
Play the stuff that you suck at on bad players and postmortem it and that's how you improve with techniques you're not good at. "Get over yourself".
Identify the small failures.  It's a snowball that builds to a moment, to a takedown, to a submission.  There are so many moments, so many small failures.

Just get underneath their arms and you'll find double and single legs.
Get your belly button on them and push them over, tie the knees together.
Try faking the side step (what you're good at) and going into a double leg.

If you handfight their elbow on the standup, they're never going to flank you.

Attack the periphery to access the spine, once you control the spine, then you can submit the periphery - souders or danaher

What is handfighting, it's getting past the elbows, that's the objective.  Over Under Around and Through.

All the grips that you do with your legs / feet have a sibling position with your hand grips.  Closed guard is just double unders, half guard is just a single leg.
There's always a handfight, even in a doubleleg, you're getting under the elbows, the handfight was invisible.

## 3/2/24
Thai clinch works because you own the centerline
Address collar tie with "over under around or through"

The 4 distances
- Too far to do anything
- hand fighting distance (as soon as you can grab their hands)
- "over under around or through" the elbows
- control of the spine (glue your bellybutton to their body)

Think of the belly button as a reference in all "distance 4" scenarios (double leg for example). Fixing belly button placement will fix head placement.

If you're locked up in a mutual collar tie, fight for centerline
"centerline control"

You can break their posture by twisting it or bending it

The overemphasis of one (O, U, A, T), leads to another.


---
Responding to the leg weave. if I already lost, they got past my knees, then I need to go defensive

You don't push something that's pushing against you.  You don't push a static object.  If is impossible for top side person to move with out taking their weight off.  Like to go to mount, they have to take their leg off the ground and for that brief moment, the leg is weightless.
He'll blindfold them and do the old wing shun kung fo drill.
If you're too tense to block the punch they get hit, but if they relax and feels it, they'll block every time.
So think of this in side control, if I'm framing and tense I wont feel it coming, but if i relax I will.
IF YOURE TENSE YOU WONT FEEL THEIR INTENTIONS.  YOU MUST BE RELAXED TO READ THEM.
You can do this blindfolded, it helps with escapes.

---
Darce escapes:
Grab the wrist and keep the shoulder down.
As soon as they relax their grip in any way, **elbow them in the armpit** and follow them out the back door.
Never go elbow deep in an anaconda because they can americaana you just by grabbing the arm and turning.
Put a lot of pressure in their shoulders: darce -> kimura, anaconda -> americana
arm in guillotine: put your shoulder on their sternum and keep them flat on their back
guillotines only work when the attacker is flat on their side

All 3 of these arm triangles are only available because they got access to my armpit.  Those chokes aren't accessible from "positions", they're accessible from "arms being opoen"

elbows in, shoulderblades back (for posture).  Reach just as far as your shoulderblade will let you.

When you reach (like from half guard), reach with a back palm (pronated) to keep your shoulder stronger (like Chris Novasky showed for retaining overhook). It keeps them from flattening you out.
When you feel this, it'll blow your mind.  Reach back palm and there's no collapsing.
This applies to defending darces too.

Homework: 
- Belly button reference
- 4 distances when it comes to elbow protection
	- game: jump to defense as soon as they get past your kness.  This should be a trigger.
- The kung fo exercise.  Play with moving when they do.  You can't move forwards without taking weight off of one leg.  Just wait for them to move and then sweep them and knock them over.  Don't try to sweep a static person.

When you have a collar tie, use a "U" grip instead of a "C" grip. The difference is the wrist bending and being a part of the grip.  If gives you more directions to apply force.  "C" grip can only go down and acrsoss, "U" grip: down, across,  and back into a guillotine.  If they're doing a collar tie on me, come underneath and flick the U grip.
You've gained access to the spine, maximize it.  You got access to the spine, bellybutton on and shoulderblades back; maximize it.

Shoudlers back and down, like yoga cobra.  Old school wrestlers keep their shoulders back, they can't reach cause they've got their shoulders short.
