Pronate your wrist when you have an overhook to lock it down and prevent them from pulling free ^wisdom

We did guard passing today, Knee slice or M1 (football hike) as alternative options.
If the knee slice fails into a knee shield, pick the lower knee up and level the opponent to neutral and reestablish your elbow and knee blocking their "shield knee".  Drive your weight into it ("bananna split") and keep your head forward and down so they can't lasso
