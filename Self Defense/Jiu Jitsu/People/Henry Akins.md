Rickson: you want to develop the ability to get out when you want. Not having to wait for their mistake


Unorganized note:
The first step in preventing guard pass is do not allow the opponent to have control of my legs

If I don’t want him to pass my guard, I just push him back

Don’t let them get under hooks. If they have your back, keep your elbows a pinned to your sides.

The majority of Ricksons training was hyper focused positional training. Even in free roll he would get to that position over and over to train it

If your goal is to tap uke out then your always trying to get to your strongest position and then you’re only getting experience in that limited scope
