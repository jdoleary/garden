	-  Walk toe to toe sliding your foot.  This prevents you from injuring your toes if you get foot swept
	-  When footsweeping, the motion comes from your whole body, don't bend at the waist.
	- Think of it like sweeping with broom across the floor, you sweep their foot just as they start to transfer their weight but before it's planted - either on the pickup or the setdown.
	- Always sweep through the centerline of their body
	- You can sweep in any direction that they move, side  to side, forward, back
	- You have to move in a half beat to catch their motion at the right time
	- Look at their shoulders to see what their feet are doing
