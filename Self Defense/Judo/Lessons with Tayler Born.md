### Lesson 1
Dominant position primarily relies on dominant head position.  [[Under Hook]]s and [[Overhook]]s are secondary.  Underhooks and overhooks are meaningless unless they are applied effectively. (Underhook: go deep and grab the shoulder, overhook: connect to yourself with your hand and drive them upward or downward).

When side by sideish in a dominant position, you're in throwing territory if their near leg is stepped back.  If it is forward, go for a [[foot sweep]] or [[Single Leg]].

When standing, your takedown targets are head, arms, and legs.  If you want one, attack one of the other two first to open up the desired target.  For example, it is difficult to [[Snap Down]] an opponent that knows it's coming, go for the arm then snap down.  But make your first attempt sincere.

[[Kazushi]] is and can be very subtle.  If you want to pickup someone's leg, lean into them first to transfer their weight to their opposite leg.  Now that target leg is light and easy to pickup.

## Lesson 2

You can Ankle Pick off of a failed [[Uchi Mata]].  Just place your lifted leg behind their rooted foot and lean into them.

## Lesson 3
- For snap down if you do it while they’re moving their front foot it’s far more effective.
- Anytime they’re looking at the floor snap them down.
- If they’re reaching for a color tie, use Lego hands and pass the arm.
- You don’t need to do the whole kung fu windmill for the arm drag, you can just pin it to their body.
- If they get the collar tie, and their elbow is bent, you can push your shoulder into it, and then turn and look behind you, not down, in order to strip it to Russian tie. 
- The elbow bend is important. You can induce it yourself by getting closer to them. 
- If they get the color tie, you can do overtie by reaching with the same side hand, grabbing their ear and pulling their head to their shoulder. 
- When it comes to foot sweeps, anytime at all that they step with a foot foot, that just stepped has more weight on it.  And so the other foot is sweepable. 
- For uchimata, step closer and get your hips under theirs. Feet parallel. With your far arm, extend forward, not in and look at your wrist watch. Even without executing the throw, they should be on their toes and almost getting pulled in a circle. Lean away at and angle and pull up with the other hook.
