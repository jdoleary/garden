### Lesson 1
Dominant position primarily relies on dominant head position.  [[Under Hook]]s and [[Overhook]]s are secondary.  Underhooks and overhooks are meaningless unless they are applied effectively. (Underhook: go deep and grab the shoulder, overhook: connect to yourself with your hand and drive them upward or downward).

When side by sideish in a dominant position, you're in throwing territory if their near leg is stepped back.  If it is forward, go for a [[foot sweep]] or [[Single Leg]].

When standing, your takedown targets are head, arms, and legs.  If you want one, attack one of the other two first to open up the desired target.  For example, it is difficult to [[Snap Down]] an opponent that knows it's coming, go for the arm then snap down.  But make your first attempt sincere.

[[Kazushi]] is and can be very subtle.  If you want to pickup someone's leg, lean into them first to transfer their weight to their opposite leg.  Now that target leg is light and easy to pickup.

## Lesson 2

You can Ankle Pick off of a failed [[Uchi Mata]].  Just place your lifted leg behind their rooted foot and lean into them.
