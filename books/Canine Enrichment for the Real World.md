## 1. Enrichment then and Now
> [Dr. Markowitz] said, "Enrichment should be a synonym for 'more like nature.'"
> ...
> enrichment can be defined _as meeting all of an animal's needs as closely as possible to how they would be met in the wild, in order to empower them to engage in species-typical behaviors in healthy and appropriate ways._

Enrichment is much more than play, toys and exercise.

## 2. The Elements of Enrichment

however, each dog is an individual and may not conform.
> Dr. Susan Friedman: "behavior is a study of one"

Many natural behaviors of dogs are identified as "bad"; however, it is often the dog attempting to fulfill their genuine needs and it is our job to direct them to opportunities to fulfill those needs in a safe and non-destructive way.

### Needs
- Natural behaviors and instinctual needs
	- Sensory stimulation
	- Scavenging
	- Foraging
	- Security
- Emotional Needs
- Physical Needs
	- Hygiene
	- Health

> Our number one criterion for how we care for our pets should be, "Is this what they actually need? How is it impacting them?" rather than, "What do I want?"

### The Humane Hierarchy
An intervention protocol to help animal trainers and behavior consultants determine which approach to take in training.
> lots of strategies will "work"... but not all strategies are equal in terms of their impact on the learner.

The hierarchy is organized in terms of what to try first and what to try last
- Wellness: Nutritional, Physical
- Antecedent Arrangements
	- How their environment is set up (intentionally or unintentionally)
- Positive Reinforcement
	- "Positive reinforcement involves providing a pleasant or desirable stimulus following a behavior, which increases the likelihood of the behavior reoccurring. For example, praising a child for completing their homework on time encourages them to continue this behavior in the future." [^1]
- Differential Reinforcement of Alternative Behaviors
	- "Differential reinforcement is a behavior modification technique used in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), which involves selectively reinforcing desired behaviors while withholding reinforcement for undesired behaviors." [^1]
- Extinction, Negative Reinforcement and Negative Punishment
	- "Extinction is the process of gradually weakening and eliminating a behavior by discontinuing the reinforcement that was previously maintaining it." [^1]
	 - "Negative reinforcement, on the other hand, involves removing an unpleasant or aversive stimulus after a behavior, also increasing the likelihood of that behavior being repeated. For instance, turning off a loud alarm when a child wakes up and gets out of bed on time serves as negative reinforcement for waking up on time." [^1]
	 - "Negative punishment is the removal of a reinforcing stimulus following a behavior in order to decrease the likelihood of that behavior occurring again." [^2]
- Positive Punishment
	- "Positive punishment is the addition of an aversive stimulus following a behavior in order to decrease the likelihood of that behavior occurring again." [^2]

> We cannot emphasize enough the importance of making sure an animal is completely healthy and pain-free before trying any other intervention.

### How to evaluate a Veterinarian
- The vet stays up to date on the latest research in their field
- The vet is thorough
- The vet is flexible and communicative
- The vet recognizes and respects the boundaries of their own expertise
- You have a good rapport with your vet
