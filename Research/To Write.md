## New Lens: Roles
**Self**
Who are you to yourself?  Do you care for your body and mind?  Do you meet your own needs?  Are you proud of yourself?  Are you on the path that you know you need to be on?
**Husband/Wife/Partner**
Are you in tune with your partner?  Do you understand the cause of their emotions and what they need?  Are you listening to understand?
**Parent**
Your children learn from every moment they are with you.  Every moment counts.  It is your job to prepare them but not to control them.  Are you creating a balanced environment? Are you meeting them where they are at?  Are you keeping your own hopes and expectations in check?
**Friend**
**Community Member**
**Citizen**

This is a lot.  How do I boil it down.  What am I getting at here?
I began with fun, then pain and powerlessness.  Then healing and control.  Then obsession with progress.  Seeking balance, achieving some.

I want to 
- Create beautiful spaces and have a state of mind that doesn't take them for granted
- Be grounding and helpful to others
- not be stuck in my past and trauma and to let go
- be capable on my feet (Judo, Wrestling)
