Observations from a ex-neurosurgeon:
https://youtu.be/25LUF8GmbFU?si=eyWLchUTiNJ9uKWp&t=1215
People that healed:
- Diet was the most important (food and liquids)
	- **Low salt**
	- **Mostly plant-based** (veggies, fruit, whole grains, beans)
	- **Not too much animal foods**
- They'd do things that make them **sweat** (exercise, sauna)
- Not drinking much, not smoking
- Good **social** support
- **Sleep** 8 hours a day
- Not stressed, or they found a way to **release the stress** (be present, be mindful)
