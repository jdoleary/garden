New intention: **Efficiency**

I've been doing Gymnastics Bodies for a few months and have noticed significant flexibility gains; however, I'm dealing with some back elbow tendonitis due to the pushups and pullups I think.

Given all that I've learned, I need to develop a new wholistic strategy focused on learning and growth efficiency.
