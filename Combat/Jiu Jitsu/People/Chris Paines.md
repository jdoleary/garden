- Who ever is in control is the person who exists between the other person's knees and armpits

	- Like kicking out of cradle or bringing your hands up to defend choke and exposing inside position while you do

Guards is a parasite because it makes you comfortable on your back
If the passer doesn’t control your bottom leg, you can just get up

If you’re the guy on top, you remove most of their submission options. 
You are on top of your hips are higher than theirs. 
“Forcing their hand into their pocket”: means “grab their wrist and elbow and force their wrist into their right pocket and glue it to their hip”
The person on the outside can do upper body attacks. The person with inside position can do lower body attacks
There’s no double leg unless they get past your hands and elbows. If you have to sprawl you’ve already made a mistake
Sometimes “just standing up” will induce your opponent to kazushi themselves or give you good grips accidentally in a wild attempt to maintain control

## Subconscious Priorities
https://youtu.be/qX30Wx5glJg?t=900 
Breathing and Balance are subconscious priorities below the primary priority of fighting.  If you interrupt either, they have to address it primarily for a moment.  Cause a reaction in those and then hunt the gap from the reaction immediately.

Superior Side __Control__
https://youtu.be/qX30Wx5glJg?t=1392
The conventional head & arm control always leaves space for them to frame on your hip, instead put both arms on one side of their head and keep their near arm in the pocket of your hip

----
The only side control escape you need to know is to get your hands to your groin
https://youtu.be/qX30Wx5glJg?t=1475
----
The rule for joint locks:
https://youtu.be/qX30Wx5glJg?t=2096
You control above and below the one you want.
There's a positional joint and a submission joint.
Armbar example: https://youtu.be/qX30Wx5glJg?t=2200
Crushing, intense control over the __positional__ joint makes the submission __way__ more dangerous / powerful.  Think of how Gordon tapped cyborg before even applying the submission, just with the control on his leg

----
Right-handedness matters, especially in positions like half-guard

Attributes: Athlete, Fighter, Martial Artist.  All exist in world champions

From a podcast: also try to avoid using strength in competition.  It's not just for training.  Being smooth and not using strength until the right moment keeps you relaxed and effective

1. "As long as I keep my hips facing the floor - my groin facing the ground - I am very difficult to sweep"

2. Whoever's hips are highest is on top. (This is useful both when sweeping and when being swept)

## 2023-09-21 Notes - 2nd Session with Chris
Good skiiers are not always balanced, they're always unbalanced and making micro adjustments to remain balanced.

Balance is an athletic skill, not a technical skill.  It's conditioned and you can lose it.

The idea of a pyramid base with 2 feet instead of 3 roots, the concept of edges and corners still applies.  You can't push someone over a corner, only an edge.

---
Attackers delete space, defenders make space
For training with bigger guys. Mess with their balance, mess with their posture.
Don't let them past your knees, don't let them control their hips.
Mess with their spine.

In wrestling you can't just grab someone by the head, you havve to go head and arm. -someone else (due to the ruleset) - Sven
The only thing you should ever be looking for is getting behind somone's shoulder - Sven
Get his shoulder behind your shoulder
**arm drag, russion tie.  Assume they're stronger, so don't move them, move yourself**
If someone's front arm opens that's the shoulder you get behind.  Just push the arm out of the way.
As soon as its open, its weak.
Every bit of hand fighting is a timing thing.
Keep your front arm down, short hand fight, don't drop your head or it'll get stnapped down.  Keep your discipline, keep your posture.  Slide step instead of walking and crossing over your feet.
Keep hunting for the back of their elbow.  Get your belly button on them (so you're not leaning forward and have connection rather than eyes up. This keeps your posture good.)

As soon as i  get past their shoulder i get my belly button on them and just drive them down.

For standing, don't bend over, keep your back up and your front arm down (close the front door)

Don't open your front arm until it has to be fired for an attack


**After I get behind their shoulder and connect, my ability to get up and behind them is based on my bottom leg being free!**

You can weave your bottom leg through your top leg so that you can get your hips facing the ground, this makes it easier to get your bottom leg free so you can get up and get behind them.

Focus on rotating your hips as fast as possible
If they start pullling their arm out and rotating back into you, you need to get your rotation in and fast

---
When defending, as soon as you feel the opportunity to create space (moving yoru hips and shoulders), do it.  (Violently start moving them).  If they can't stop your movement your out, if they're trying to stop it, they can't submit them.

3 planes of motion: Rotate on the axis, extend and contract, laterally move shoulders and hips
Perfect back control has to address all of these.

Nexst time someone is on my back, go left or right, move your shoulders or move your hips laterally, and contract or extend.  If you start moving yhour shoulders they'll hold your shoulders tighter and loosen on your hips and vice versa.  Just get you back off their chest.

Create space all of the time and they will have a much harder time submitting you.

## Key points
- [[Balance]] is the trunk of the "Tree of Jiu Jitsu", therefore
	- If you maintain balance, you vastly limit your opponent's options
	- If you compromise the opponent's balance, you give yourself options
	- You could focus on nothing else but balance and be great at Jiu Jitsu
	- "As long as I keep my hips facing the floor - my groin facing the ground - I am very difficult to sweep"
- Whoever's hips are highest is **on top** or will inevitably become the one of top.
- In order to **get up** you must have a free bottom leg
	- This applies to taking the back / getting behind your opponent and getting up when playing guard
- Alignment is the brother of balance, is it what allows you to maintain balance
	- Imagine triangle on the ground made by lines connecting the points of your body in contact with the ground.  This is your [[base]].
	- Your base can only be compromised by pushing you over an edge, not a corner, of that shape.
	- Your base can only be compromised by pushing you over an edge, not a corner, of that shape.
	- This principle applies even when you're standing.  The shape is just a line between your feed, but if you fall, it will be because you were pushed or pulled over the edge, the line between your feet, and not over a corner (the feet themselves)
	- Therefore, when standing, remain with the line facing your opponent, or else you are weak and can be easily toppled.
	- This is why we shift, instead of step, when moving in a combat stance.  We do not let our feet cross each other.
- When both combatants are standing, to take them down your only objective is to get behind their shoulder and connect.
	- Think of keeping your belly button connected to them (this ensures good posture)
