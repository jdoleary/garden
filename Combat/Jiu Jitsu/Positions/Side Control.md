[[Funnel of Control]]:
- Body Position. [[Defense]]: Keep them down by your hips
- Underhooks / Frames / Arm position
- Center of gravity / weight distribution
- Head Control
- **Survival Position**
	- On your side vs flattened out
		- Flattened out is determined by the defenders shoulder.  If the attacker can press into their shoulder (via the arm) they have the leverage to flatten the defender out.  This is why Henry Akins says you shouldn't push on them when they pass your guard with an outstretched arm because that force is transferred directly into your shoulder and it flattens you.
	- [Eliminate the connection to the shoulder](https://youtu.be/nmB6cqyad8s?t=356) by stretching your hand out and turning your thumb down.  This prevents them from flattening you out. [[Henry Akins]]
	- Seek to stretch under their arm with your top arm (like an underhook but not grabbing)
	- Important detail, when you are on your side you must be facing **towards** Uke.

	- Control the tricep to prevent them getting to north south
	- Look away
I'm realizing that both the ghost and the phantom escapes both operate with the same underlying principle.  Both arms go my-hip-side, one is used to "shuck" my opponent off my as I shrimp out and the other prevents them from moving their arm to the other side to re-establish control.

- [JJM Elbow Escape](https://youtu.be/w-U1N_oSwEQ?t=122)
	- Important to have outside elbow under chin
	- Move foot outside of hipline in preparation for the bridge
	- Drive both elbows above head	
	 - Push on a diagonal, not towards his hip where he has strength. [Note the direction of movement (diagonal line)](https://youtu.be/w-U1N_oSwEQ?t=153)

- [If they transition to back, get to your knees](https://youtu.be/hYeSTPJQWog?t=571) Always get up facing your opponent [[Henry Akins]]
	- If they transition from side to back, you can always just get to your knees, because they don’t have control you can get to your knees whenever you want.
