	- Once you have it locked up, point your elbow, don't roll over it and then pull up with the other arm to crush
	- Using the blade of your wrist is important too (don't get it too deep); keep the blade of your wrist on their neck.  He even wiggles the blade to find the right spot on the neck
	- Then he brings the other hand as high as he can https://youtu.be/MWMNq8DGHyo?t=250 which pulls the blade into the neck

	- Monitor the posture
	- Open the elbow
	- Don't let them touch your hip
		- Note: This doesn't apply if you can mount with the Darce
	- Don't lock it up too early
- Detail: Drive the chin into the chest https://youtu.be/EksV1wbSJKg?t=151, https://youtu.be/EksV1wbSJKg?t=359, https://youtu.be/KZY4ectyvjo?t=59
	- if you lock it up correctly, you don't need to squeeze
- Tip: To deepend the Darce, slide your shoulder into their armpit https://youtu.be/KZY4ectyvjo?t=42
- Tip: [Bring your lock to your hand](https://youtu.be/KZY4ectyvjo?t=49) so as to not loose the crushing pressure. https://youtu.be/KZY4ectyvjo?t=75
- Detail: Don't post your elbow on the ground, that will make you lose the space around the neck. https://youtu.be/KZY4ectyvjo?t=211
- Detail: [Pull in it tight - elbows to your chest, not up high](https://youtu.be/KZY4ectyvjo?t=165) This is one way to close the space in the arm triangle, to lower your elbows to your chest.  You have more strength here and the gap is smaller
