If you get submitted...
â€¦ it is due to one of the following:
- Bad Habits (giving up inside position, not maintaining center of gravity, etc.)
- Lack of knowledge of what is good change and what is bad change (traversal along the funnel)
- Lack of knowledge of what to do (how to escape, how to survive)
- Lack of anticipation (experience)

## Funnel of Control
The Funnel of Control is the process of conflict.  The higher up the funnel you are, the more control and options you have.  The lower down the funnel your opponent is, the less control and options they have.
The higher up the funnel you start, the easier it is to make changes that will induce a desirable outcome.

## Jiu Jitsu Rainbow
The Jiu Jitsu Rainbow both demonstrates which core competency of Jiu Jitsu should be mastered at each best and suggests how each element corresponds to it's opposite.  To successfully Survive, you are preventing Submission, to successfully Escape you must subvert Control.  The bottom half of the rainbow involves dominant positions, the top half involves undesirable positions and "Transition" is the bridge to travel from one to the other.
