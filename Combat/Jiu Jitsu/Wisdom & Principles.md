- Principle: Work in diagonals to weaken your opponent
	- [if you're trying to open an elbow, you crawl your hand in the diagonal](https://youtu.be/GshEzcqlUbY?t=203)
	- [if you're trying to kimura, the power line from shoulder to hip is the diagonal you position yourself on for maximum power](https://youtu.be/p-6lmaseoGI?t=216)

- You must stay relaxed.  [If you're tense, every time you want to attack you'll have to relax first](https://youtu.be/gXneeWr47u8?t=100)
- "Where your head goes your body follows"
	- I hear this a lot but it applies in so many different situations.

- Work in **diagonal lines**. "Skinny X"
	- Whether it's Danaher's Kimura or JJM's Side Control Elbow escape, to be optimally efficient, you must push against a wall (your partner) where it is weak.  If you push into it's support beam, you do not succeed, if you push at an angle, you tip it over.
- Learn to build a wheel from scratch, but donâ€™t reinvent the wheel.  Other people have worked tirelessly to find the best wheel design, learn from them first before you try to make your own from scratch.  It'll save you countless hours.

- The ultimate principle: **Efficiency**.  High efficiency results in energy saved and more effective submissions.
- **Connection**
- When you lock up your limbs (figure-four, lockdown), you may have to release the lock before utilizing them.
