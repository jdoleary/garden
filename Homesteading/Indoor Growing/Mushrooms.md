| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
|Reusable| Higher initial investment|
| Less Plastic Waste| Limited Species |
| Easy to scale | Time cleaning Buckets|
| Low operation cost | |

#### Instructions
- Drill 1/2" - 3/4" holes
	- Smaller holes result in small clusters
	- Bigger holes leads to drying out
- Prep Substrate (Hardwood Pellets)
	- Pasteurize (boil or hydrated lime)
- Recipe (Fills 5 buckets)
	- 40 Liters of water
	- 40 lbs of sawdust pellets
	- 16 lbs of soy hull pellets (to add nitrogen)
- Ensure proper moisture content:
	- Compress mixture with hands until you can barely squeeze out a couple droplets of water
- Inoculate
	- 6lbs of grain spawn
	- Sanitize bag with 70% isopropyl alcohol
	- Break up spawn and add to mixture
- Incubate (Grain takes longer to incubate than straw) (straw: ~2 weeks)
	- It **doesn't** need lots of fresh air, light, or humidity
	- Don't put them get too close together, as they incubate they build heat and you want air to flow around them
	- At home, cover buckets with a tarp or put them in a closet
	- Once you see "little mushrooms" forming (pinning), this means the substrate is colonized

- Fruit
- Harvest
	- Harvest before caps flatten out
- Retire Buckets
	- Dump outside, use as compost, mulch
	- (These can still produce mushrooms outside)
