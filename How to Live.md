All of my notes, here and in journals, are my attempt to refine my philosophy of how I should live which in-turn determines who I should and will become.

I try to refine the idea but it grows and grows; however, I will try to establish the trunk and every other page in this garden will dive into the complexity of various branches and leaves.
### Maximal Agency
Knowing I have and behaving with agency is key to becoming who I ought to be.  It empowers me to look at any situation or event from the lens of "what I can do in response" which in turn gives me as much power as is available to myself to act and change things.  This means **taking responsibility** as much is as reasonably possible.
## Physical Health
Health is fundamental and my greatest advantage.  My body performs and thinks better when I am healthy (both long-term health and short term health).  I am slower to anger, clearer or mind, more reasonable and rational and make better decisions when I am:
- Well Rested
- Exercised and Nutritiously Moved
- Eating Well
- Eliminating Well
- Maintaining Good Relationships
- Breathing Well
From a point of good health, I have maximized my own power and agency and can then go and improve external things (people, places).
## Mental Health
Physical Health takes priority as it is a major contributor to mental health.  Mental health challenges are often more abstract and harder to solve. For example:
- loneliness
- anxiety
- depression
- shame
- fear
- purpose
- self-esteem
- standing up for oneself
- honesty
## Somatic Health
This is the bridge between the mind and the body.  It is the ability to listen and understand what your body is communicating with you.  Where your tension is, what your emotions mean, where pain is coming from verses where it is felt.  Deepening your intuition and respecting it's power and messaging.  Feeling how food affects your body.

## Death
Having a good relationship with Death is key in Living Well. It is also very challenging.  Facing the idea of Death makes you much stronger.  It also increases your agency because you are less likely to act wrongly out of fear.  Living Well is synonymous with Dying Well.  This ought to be explored, but only by those who have already achieved strong and stable Mental Health.
## Habits
Habits are key to how I spend my time and what decisions I make.  My environment dictates my habits more than anything.  For more, see [[Atomic Habits]].

## Self Defense
